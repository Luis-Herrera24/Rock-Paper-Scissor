# Rock Paper Scissors Game

This project is a simple **Rock Paper Scissors** game written in C++. The player competes against the computer in a best-of-three format. The game follows the classic rules where:
- **Rock** beats **Scissors**

The game demonstrates basic programming concepts like input validation, random number generation, string manipulation, and simple control flow in C++.

## Features
